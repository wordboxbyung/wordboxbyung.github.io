WordBox is an iPhone app designed for student or someone who wants to improve their English vocabulary. It allows you to store words you want to learn, take a test and monitor your progress, and parent to set words for their child to learn and monitor their progress.

It’s main features includes:

* Add new word that you want to learn. When you come across new word, you can copy and paste or use your phone’s camera to scan the new word and its usage into WordBox and click a button to download its definition and pronunciation.
* Comes with hundreds of suggested words for you to start learning right away. And if you keep adding new word, over time, it will hold lots of words. It’s a word box.
* Test random words or words that are ‘flagged’ and monitor your progress.
* For parent, you can set new words for your child to learn and monitor their progress. You do this within the app by selecting words and sharing them to your child to import those words, automatically flagged for learning and immediate test, into their WordBox. Once test result is submitted, an email is sent to you with the results for your inspection. You can open the result attachment with your app to move those words to under the “Done” tap to be in sync with your child’s app.
* Sort words by its root, creation date, or alphabetically.
* View, edit, delete words.
* Flag words for test.
* Share words with other. 
* Search a word in your app.
* Use your own pronunciation of a word.
* Scan text to create new word.
* Sequentially pronounce words in your app.
* Import words from file.
* Email test results to parent to monitor their child’s progress.
* No ads.
