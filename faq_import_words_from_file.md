**How to import words from file?**
1. Create a `.json` or `.ung` file containing words to import to `WordBox`. See [example.json](https://wordboxbyung.github.io/faq_example_json) for an example file.
1. Copy the file to `WordBox\words` directory. You can have multiple files in this directory.
1. In `WordBox` app, tap `Word Store` at the bottom tab bar to show `Word Store` page.
1. Keep scrolling down the page until a spinning wheel appears at the top with `Refreshing Table` text under it; then lift your finger to import words from the files in the app's `words` directory. On completion, all files in the `words` directory will be deleted.
